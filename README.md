PROJECT PROPOSAL:

The purpose of this project is to Extract, Transform, and Load data from 2 sources into a database. For this project we have chosen a dataset of gun-violence incidents from data.world (Geocoded: Incidents of Gun Violence in San Antonio (2018)), which we will join by date with weather data obtained from OpenWeatherMap to determine any correlations between daily temperatures and gun violence incidence. Once the data is extracted, and cleaned, we will store it in a SQL database.
